Presentations done at Barcamp Charleston 09.

xmpp - an introduction to xmpp and a rock, paper, scissors example game.


erlang - quick overview of erlang.


XMPP NOTES:

Give more detail in the basics of XMPP. It was too quick/technical for an intro.

@self - slow down and follow notes. too fast with s2s, JID, rfcs, ietf, etc.

Maybe split up presentations, intro and dev. 

Rock, paper, scissors needs to be done with all XMPP stanzas for better example.
Presence, message, and IQs

Give more details in examples and demos. A broader range of demos.

 - wiki, whiteboarding, jingle, etc.

BOSH explanation needs more detail and description.

Idea - Do presentation in XMPP and display it via XMPP client or WEB.


ERLANG NOTES: 

  Have an outline ready incase people aren't into hacking and need an introduction.
